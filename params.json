  "body": "### README\r\nThis is a repository of screening estimates for chronic health hazards (primarily cancer risk) along major transportation corridors in the Bay Area.\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on recent (circa 2014) estimates of traffic intensity (VMT) along state highways and major roads, combined with emission factors (g/VMT) from EMFAC2014. Estimates of emissions and associated risks attributable to diesel locomotives operating on rail(roads) are also included.\r\n\r\n\"Screening estimates\" means that these are believed to be conservative estimates of \"average expected\" concentrations and risks. At any given location, more complete information on traffic patterns, prevailing winds, presence/absence of buildings, etc., could drive a different estimate of \"site-specific\" risk.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHave a question? Please contact David Holstius (@holstius) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.",
